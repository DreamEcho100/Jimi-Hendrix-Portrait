            <h3>Castles Made of Sand</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace" </li>
                <li>As she slams the door in his drunken face, And now he stands outside</li>
                <li>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool He cries "</li>
                <li>Oh girl, you must be mad What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</li>
                <li>Against the door he leans and starts a scene</li>
                <li> And his tears fall and burn the garden green And so castles made of sand</li>
                <li>Fall in the sea, eventually A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</li>
                <li>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends</li>
                <li>And he built a dream that when he grew up</li>
                <li>He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief Many moons passed and more the dream grew stronger</li>
                <li>Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song</li>
                <li>And fight his first battle, but something went wrong</li>
                <li>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made</li>
                <li>of sand, Melts into the sea, eventually There was a young girl</li>
                <li>whose heart was a frown, 'Cause she was crippled for life, and she couldn't</li>
                <li>speak a sound And she wished and prayed she could stop living</li>
                <li>So she decided to die She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and</li>
                <li>to her legs she smiled "You won't hurt me no more" But then a sight</li>
                <li>she'd never seen made her jump and say "Look, a golden winged ship is</li>
                <li>passing my way" And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on</li>
                <li>going And so castles made of sand</li>
            </ul>
